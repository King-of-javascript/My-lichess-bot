# ♟️ Lichess Logic Bot
This is an automated chess bot that plays on Lichess using the official Bot API.

## 🚀 How it Works
1. **Listen:** It connects to the Lichess stream to wait for a game.
2. **Think:** When an opponent moves, it sends the board to an engine (like Stockfish).
3. **Move:** It sends the best move back to the board automatically.
